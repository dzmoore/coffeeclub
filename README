CoffeeCoffeeCoffeeClub (or CoffeeClub for short) is a small web application intended to be used
by a group setting to administer "coffee clubs".  "Coffee clubs" are simply a group of people
(probably coworkers) that drink and share coffee frequently.  The group can decide which member
will make the coffee, and the CoffeeClub application can be used to keep track of the type of
drink (a description could describe the beans or brewing process used) and how much the coffee
creator wishes to charge the other members for a cup (hopefully s/he is just recouping costs).
